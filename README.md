# Simple Port Scanner
Welcome to my simple port scanner! This tool allows you to scan a range of IP addresses and ports to see which ones are open.

## How to use
To use the port scanner, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download Python 3 here.

Once you have Python 3 installed, you can clone this repository or download the port_scanner.py file. Navigate to the directory containing the file in your terminal, and then run the command python port_scanner.py to start the scan.

You will be prompted to enter the range of IP addresses and the range of ports that you want to scan. The scanner will then attempt to connect to each IP address and port combination and report which ones are open.
